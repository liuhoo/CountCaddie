This is a iOS application to keep track of simple and advanced score statistics on the golf course. Currently runs on UserDefaults as temporary database. 

## Inspiration

Throughout my competitive junior golf career, I had to keep statistics to find weak points in my game and figure out how to improve. This was mainly in the form of pencil and paper. This would be very inefficient. Now much later in my career with more knowledge in the field of computer science, the statistics that I were keeping were easy to adapt to mobile app/website. Currently the app store offers a range of scoring and statistic-tracking apps. However none of them encompass the range of statistics that I used throughout my junior golf career.
